# ⚙️ Basic Calculator - Simple Java Arithmetic Operations  

## 📄 Overview  
The **Basic Calculator** is a straightforward **Java-based console application** designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. This project is perfect for beginners looking to understand **user input handling, conditional statements, methods, and loops in Java**.  

---

## ✨ Features  
- 🗒️ **User Input Handling** – Accepts two numbers and an operation choice from the user  
- ➕ **Performs Basic Arithmetic** – Supports **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division**  
- 🛠️ **Method Usage** – Implements Java methods for **modular and reusable code**  
- 🔄 **Looping Demonstration** – Prints a message multiple times using loops  
- ⚡ **Easy to Understand** – Simple and well-structured Java program for beginners  

---

## 🔄 How It Works  
1. The program prompts the user to **enter two numbers**.  
2. It then displays a **menu of arithmetic operations**.  
3. The user selects an operation (**A for Add, S for Subtract, M for Multiply, D for Divide**).  
4. The program performs the chosen arithmetic operation and displays the result.  
5. Additional **predefined method calls** showcase multiplication, addition, and message looping.

## 🚀 How to Use  
1. **Run the program** in a Java-supported environment.  
2. **Enter two numbers** when prompted.  
3. **Choose an operation** from the displayed menu.  
4. **View the calculated result** in the console.  
5. **Observe additional method calls** demonstrating multiplication and looping.

## 🔧 Technologies Used  
- **Java 17** (or later)  
- **Scanner Class** for user input  
- **Conditional Statements** (`if-else`) for operation selection  
- **Methods** for reusable and structured code  
- **Loops (`for`)** for repeated execution  

---

## 🎯 Future Improvements  
- 🌐 **Enhance User Experience** – Improve input prompts and error handling  
- 🛠️ **Fix Duplicate Conditions** – Resolve redundant `if` conditions in operation selection  
- ⏳ **Implement Continuous Mode** – Allow users to perform multiple calculations without restarting  
- 🔄 **Add More Functions** – Introduce modulus, power, and square root operations  
- 🎨 **Develop a GUI Version** – Build a graphical user interface for easier interaction
